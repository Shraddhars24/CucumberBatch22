component 1 - feature file
component 2 - step definition
component 3 - Runner class/Test Runner

Background - it is applicable to feature file
Background will be different for different feature files
   All the steps can be taken in background which are common across all the scenarios of
   one feature file till the flow is not broken

Hooks - in hooks, we keep pre condition and post condition of all the scenarios
        from all the feature files

Rules for Hooks - it should be available under steps package
   We have 2 Hooks in Cucumber - @before and @after

Flow of execution after implementing hooks and background
   Hooks - Background - Scenario

Data driven testing - when one test case executes against multiple sets of data
    hooks,background and scenario will be executed based on total sets of data
    we implement scenario outline with examples table

Framework -

main - developers
test - QA automation engineers - to write the code through which we test

Java - to write all java classes
resources - to write all non java stuff such as feature files, excel,config files etc

features directory
I need to keep all the feature files at one place so create directory features for  all the feature files under resources

Utility package - common methods class - all the methods and webdriver to be used
config reader class to read all the properties from config.prop file

Page Object Model Design pattern
 We create page classes in this as per the screens in the application
